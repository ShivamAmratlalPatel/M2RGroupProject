My key contribution in this project was programming the environment and simulations.
Coming into the project, I had completed various other projects and hackathons which required programming skills so was excited when this opportunity presented itself.
I was also familiar with git and implemented the use of this both for our codebase, and our report within our group to ensure an effective workflow.
Furthermore, from my experience of latex, I set up the report, referencing methods and taught our group how to use a .bib file and cite to accurately reference work and ensure consistency within the group.
I also took the role of 'group leader' on and delegated tasks to each member of the group and ensured we were working at an efficient pace, which was important in such a short timeline.
